**Learning Vulnerabilities which I recommed to :**

Portswigger is best resource to learn web security, hands-on labs + deep theory

1. Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control

2. Business logic vulnerabilities  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws

3. Cross-site scripting

5. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

6. Race conditions

Till now you have learn the vulnerabilities out of which you can make a decent living.

But learning should never stop : 

I advice you to start testing apps now daily for three hours + 2 hours learning.

Learn From Real World Reports that are submitted read as much as you can for 6 months.

1. https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/overview  
2. https://pentester.land/writeups/

Now go on hackerone.com and signup as a hacker.

But You don't have a methodology.

So learn from the OG ZseanO

And Also Read His Book :

Now you have a methodology.  
START HACKING STUFF

## My Advice :

1. Focus on one program high paying program with a lot of features.
2. Focus on main app only don't do recon.
3. Start by looking for one vulnerability only that is IDOR and Access Control Issues, It is everywhere , easy to find and Impactful.

# Final Advice: Just don't give up. Be consistent. Don't aim for perfectionâ€”show up every day, even if it's just for one hour. Small actions compound over time.

## Timeline :

- Basics : 3 Months  
- Tooling and Vulnerabilities : 3-5 Month, Just learn completely.  
- Hacking + Learning : 6 Month [3 hours hacking + 2 hours Reading real world reports]  
- After That Just go all in into it.
