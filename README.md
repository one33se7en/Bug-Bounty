# Bug Bounty guide I wish someone gave me when I was starting out.

## THE BASICS

This is the boring part, but the foundations is needed.

- How computers work : Complete Every Unit -> https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:digital-information

- Networking Basics : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj-Yfakjllc&list=PLIFyRwBY_4bRLmKfP1KnZA6rZbRHtxmXi

- Learn Linux : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEx7B_PTOE&list=PLIhvC56v63IJIujb5cyE13oLuyORZpdkL

Uninstall Windows and Install Linux as your main OS.

- Learn Web fundamentals :

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Gd-MGaleE&list=PLUU3EzfPr915ebZONvUVHKm8Bls6D7EgA

- Learn Basic Coding :

You can skip this if you want but it's better to learn if you want to be good in the long term :

**The Tooling :**

- Burp Suite :

**Learning Vulnerabilities which I recommed to :**

Portswigger is best resource to learn web security, hands-on labs + deep theory

1. Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control

2. Business logic vulnerabilities  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws

3. Cross-site scripting  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting

4. CSRF  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf

5. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors

6. Race conditions  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions

7. Server-side request forgery (SSRF)  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf

8. API testing  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/api-testing

9. Web LLM attacks  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/llm-attacks

10. GraphQL API vulnerabilities  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql

11. Web cache poisoning  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning

12. Web cache deception  
https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-deception.

Till now you have learn the vulnerabilities out of which you can make a decent living.

But learning should never stop : 

I advice you to start testing Web Applications now daily for 3 hours + 2 hours learning. Don't think about money just open your burp and browser, Pick one target and starting testing it.

For 2 hour learning, Read real world reports that are submitted by other hackers read as much as you can for 6 months :

1. https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/overview  
2. https://pentester.land/writeups/

Now go on hackerone.com and signup as a hacker.

Oh Wait, But You don't have a methodology.

And Also Read His Book :  
https://www.bugbountyhunter.com/methodology/zseanos-methodology.pdf

Now you have a methodology.  
START HACKING STUFF

## My Advice :

1. Focus on one program high paying program with a lot of features.
2. Focus on main app only don't do recon.
3. Start by looking for one vulnerability only and master it and that is IDOR and Access Control Issues, It is everywhere , easy to find and Impactful.

Don't look for other bugs unless it's on your face, Because jack of all trades, Master of none. SO IT'S BETTER TO BE MASTER OF ONE.

People are making a decent living out of only IDORs and Access Contol Issues.

### Watch these videos to make good methodology :

# Final Advice: Just don't give up. Be consistent. Don't aim for perfectionâ€”show up every day, even if it's just for one hour. Small actions compound over time.

## Timeline :

- Basics : 3 Months
- Tooling and Vulnerabilities : 3 Month, Just learn completely.  
- Hacking + Learning : 6 Month [3 hours hacking + 2 hours Reading real world reports]
- After That Just go all in into it.
